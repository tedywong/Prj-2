Yankees surprisingly interview Eric Wedge for manager opening

If you thought the New York Yankees’ decision to move on from Joe Girardi was a shock, wait until you see who they interviewed as his possible replacement. The team confirmed Friday that it had met with former Cleveland Indians and Seattle Mariners skipper Eric Wedge about its current manager vacancy.

This comes as quite a surprise. When the Yankees parted ways with Girardi, it was assumed they would look for a manager who could connect with players, embrace analytics and had an existing relationship to the organization. Wedge was never known for embracing stats, and doesn’t have a previous relationship with the Yankees, so he lacks at least two of those three qualities
